# brinet
Brinet is a custom feed that pulls info from multiple data sources, and uploads them to Bluesky.

These data sources include:
- Actions on Bills in the US Congress
- Reddit r/worldnews

To setup, PTAL at, complete, and rename `.env.template` to `.env`.
You should then be able to run `brinet` locally with the following command from the root of the project:
```
npm run start
```
